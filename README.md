Fibonacci-Sequence
==================

This Python code will generate a Fibonacci sequence either N numbers long, or up to a value N.


When prompted, the user should enter either 'count' or 'value' for the first question, and any positive integer for the second.

'count' will run through the Fibonacci sequence and continue to print values until it has printed 'count' amount of values.
'value' will run through the Fibonacci sequence and print values until it hits one that it equal or greater than the supplied value.

I've added some safety to the program, namely that it will spit out an error on misspelled answers to the first question. It will also convert anything to lowercase as a precaution.
